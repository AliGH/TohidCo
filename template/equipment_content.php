This molding line is made by Heinrich Wagner Sinto Company in Germany in 2000 with nominal capacity of 75 molds per hour that has mold dimension with 860x660x300(mm). This machine works with high pressure system and it can be controlled by central server system via connecting to net. This molding line has automatic pouring melt system, robot for picking up castings, shaking out system, etc.<br />
*Semi Automatic Molding Line (JSQ)<br />
This molding line is Jolt Squeeze line that made in Germany. this line has some pneumatic presses in format 40 with mold dimension of 800x1000mm and also in format 30 with mold dimension of 630x800mm. In this line, vibrating and impaction simultaneously compact the sand and mold with form. The capacity of this line is 30 molds per minute.

      This department has a Jorge Fisher machine that is made by France according to order of Citroen and Peugeot companies. It has 20 turbines with capacity of 3000 RPM also it has 5 vibrator that can conduct the shot metals towards elevator in order to well shot blasting for castings. This machine has a vessel with capacity of 20 tons for shot metals. Adjusting and controlling of this machine is by a PLC that caused high efficiency about 250 tons of casting for the machine.
